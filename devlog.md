Created git repository for Project 2, as usual instructions for project formats in this class.

# April 8 10:55pm

This will be a single application project, per the assignment. Within the single file will be classes for the Teller and Customer. They will use semaphores, as learned from class.

# April 8 10:58pm

Starting first session. Bank.py will be created to sync both sides of the project, the Customer and Teller, to eventually lead to an output. Will need to import threading module for python language and threading.Semaphore for sync.
